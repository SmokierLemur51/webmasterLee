IDEAS

	Daily report for me to not forget things,
	mainly the little things. Like Lauren is in
	the office on thursdays. Or that check ins
	are on wednesdays.
		
		would need to be created by me since I 
		tend to ignore all other notifications.


	Task/Ticket management system along with schedule
	help. The goal is to not overdo myself with high
	expectations. I do not have a lot in the tank.


	Meal plan creator. Create meal plans off of things
	that I like to cook based off of my energy level.
